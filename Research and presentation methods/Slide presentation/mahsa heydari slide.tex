%\subsection{Simple Text}
The groups’ FAOs are linked through the Internet FAQ consortium at
http://www.faqs.org/. These lists are designed to inform new users about
fre quently asked questions and to help prevent regular readers from rereading
responses to questions that have been dealt with on many previous
occasions. Use quotes to reference only relevant material from a previous
post to which you are responding. A brief quotation is useful to provide
context; however, long inclusions of past comments only waste bandwidth
and add to screen clutter. Follow the discourse for a few weeks before posting
comments or questions yourself to insure that your particular question
is relevant to the interests of the list members.
If in doubt about the appropriateness of a potential posting, email it privately
to the list owner for feedback before posting it publicly. The use of
HTML coding and the addition of attachments to postings always add to
the size of the message and may result in messages that cannot be read b
all members of the list. A better solution is to post an announcement of the
avail ability of the resource to the list, Usenet group, or virtual conference
and to post longer or multimedia messages and files to a Web site where
the interested reader can selectively retrieve them.
Create a separate file folder in your mailbox for information you are sent
when first subscribing to a new list. These first subscriber information
postings will tell you how to resign or suspend your membership in the
list-information that may be relevant but very difficult to find when you
wish to resign from the group or change your email address.
Virtual Conferences
The first virtual conference” on the Internet was organized in 1992 fr
the Interna tional Council for Distance Education (Anderson and Mason,
1993). Subsequently, vir tual conferences have proliferated and continue
to provide a forum for professional development that is much more costeffective
and accessible than their face-to-face equivalent (for example see

http://www.rmrple.com). Virtual conferences are time delimited in that
they use combinations of synchronous and asynchronous tools to sup port
presentation and dialogue for a limited period of time and usually on a
particular topic (Anderson, 1996), Like their face-to-face counterparts, virtual
conferences usu ally include keynote presentations, promotional displays,
and small group discussions. Such conferences provide ideal means
for e-researchers to gain low-cost exposure to major spokespersons in their
field. Announcements of upcoming virtual conferences can be found on
appropriate mailing lists, Usenet groups, or the home pages of spon soring
organizations.

\begin{frame}{Direct Email}
Writing directly to an expert in the field may be a useful way for the eresearcher
to gain invaluable access to the ”informal network.” The use of
powerful search engines usually allows one to enter the expert’s name (in
quotations and possibly with a key word appended, if the name is very
common) and find a Web site with relevant information, including the expert’s
email address and phone number. However, the novice e-researcher
should be careful not to abuse this availability and should utilize such contacts
only when other, less demanding forms of communication have been
exhausted.Most experts whom you would like to reference in your literature
review are very busy people-if they were not, you probably wouldn’t
be interested in their work. In addition, most experts write books, publish
articles, and create Web sites so that you can gain access to their ideas and
comments. Attempts by the novice e-researcher to short circuit the process
and go directly and personally to the expert, without check ing their public
work, will likely be interpreted as bothersome and not be answered.
As an example of an inappropriate request, we recently received an
email froma graduate student studying in a foreign country. The email
noted that the student had read one of our articles, liked it, and wondered
if we could send more information. Since we had no idea which article was
read (we have been publishing for many years), we were not inclined to even
answer the letter. Alternatively, legitimate, well informed, clearly written,
and polite questions and concerns may not only be answered, but may be
appreciated and lead to further contacts with experts in the field.
Filtering Messages for Others
It is impossible to follow all of the discussion groups and Web sites that
may have information relevant to your field of study. Thus, many successful
e-researchers develop informal networks of friends and colleagues who

\end{frame}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Comtinue Direct Email}
filter relevant information from their own explorations of the network and
forward appropriate messages, links, or referrals to them. ’This filtering
can become institutionalized as the researcher sets up a formal or informal
mailing list for messages or references that contain informa tion relevant
to the members of the list. In the early days of networking, prior to the
Internet, this transporting of information between networks was referred to
as porting and porters were celebrated as ”Unsung heroes of the Network
Nation!” (Masthead, NerweaverMagazine).
Making Effective Use of the Informal Network Resources
To maximize the effectiveness of an inquiry, an e-researcher must be careful
to ask a question or request assistance in an appropriate manner. s in any
conversation, the researcher must be sure to use a manner and tone that is
polite, respectful, and appre ciative. In addition, e-researchers must insure
that they have done their own literature review and research work before
asking others to do it for them.
For example, a question such as ”Does anyone know anything about
school dropout for a research paper I’m doing?” will likely not result in
any assistance and will certainly let the members of the group know you
have a great deal to learn about both the subject and the etiquette of
Net-based discussions. A refined request such as Tito’s model of student
dropout seems to be used often in postsecondary, but an ERIC search turns
up only a single study in a secondary school context. Does anyone on this
list (Usenet group, or virtual conference) know of any work, using Tinto’g
model in this area or have any ideas why it is not appropriate?” This latter
phrasing illustrates that you have done some research and thinking and
may well be a useful con tact and serious e-researcher.
Citing Net-based Resources in the Literature Review
There are a number of formats for referencing documents and correspondence
obtained from the Internet. In general the format for most styles
follows that pre scribed for the referencing of paper-based documents, with
the addition of the Uni form Resource Locator (URL) and the date of access
of the document appended to the end of the reference. For example,
in American Psychology Association (APA) format the equivalent paper
reference is followed by the words:
Retrieved on date from the World Wide Web. bntp://site address
Some citing guidelines (notably APA) do not encourage private emails,
unarchived list postings, or postings to Usenet groups in the reference bib-

\begin{frame}{Continue DIRECT EMAIL}
liography, because obtain ing a copy of the correspondence may be difficult
or impossible for the interested reader. Instead, these guidelines suggest
referencing such private or difficult to retrieve material as ”private email
correspondence from name on date” or ”posting to list name on date” within
the text of the document. Other guides suggest that this information be
kept and made available to the interested reader and that it be referenced
in the bibli ography in the format:
Anderson, T. (16 September 200D). Subject: When will our book be
published? [email to H. Kanulea], [Online]. Available email:

PLAGIARISM AND NETWORKED SOURCES Most academic writing
has liberal doses of direct quotations from the works of others This
practice lends authenticity to the literature review and, done properly, can
even enhance the readability of the literature review. However, it is imperative
that the work of others be properly acknowledged. Even if a quotation
is not used directly, ideas that are paraphrased by the researcher need to
be credited to the original source. Given the pervasiveness of ideas, papers,
reference sources, and commentaries on the Net, e-researchers may feel they
are drowning in a bewildering and immense sea of information, sources, and
references. They may even have trouble remembering where or even if the
idea or quotation they have gathered came from another source or is original
work. There is no easy solution to this problem, except to remember
that qual ity research is systematic. An electronic or paper notebook
